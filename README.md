# Instagram API

This application grabs the user’s photos that were posted within the vacinity

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Instagram API

User’s login to the app with their instgram account and give location access. Once granted, the API checks for latitude, longitude and append’s those images to the DOM for client side viewing.

## Lessons Learned:
Pretty tricky stuff. I’d like to go back and do this project again.
